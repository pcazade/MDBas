For building the documentation, please install :
* doxygen
* graphviz

and then :

doxygen ./Doxyfile.config

-------------------------------- COMPILE & INSTALL ----------------------------------
* Be sure to have a MPI implementation installed : openMPI or MPICH2 are available on most repositories.
* Be sure to have FFTW3 installed (http://www.fftw.org/), available on most repositories.
* Be sure to have CMAKE installed (http://www.cmake.org/), available on most repositories.

* Create a build directory and move to that directory: 
	mkdir build && cd build

* For buildind a debug or release SERIAL version : 
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
or
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

* For building a debug or release PARALLEL version using MPI :
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_MPI=ON ..
or
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_MPI=ON .. 

* Debug builds are slower but useful when debugging with gdb or valgrind.

* Then, once cmake built a Makefile, just execute :
	make

* For a verbose make, use : 
	make VERBOSE=1

* Please never edit this autogenerated Makefile, edit the CMakeLists.txt instead.
